# AI Terminal Copilot - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Terminal Copilot (SudoSu) is a sophisticated desktop application that provides an intelligent terminal assistant experience similar to Cursor or Kiro, but specifically designed for DevOps and terminal operations. The system combines a multi-agent AI workflow with real-time terminal interaction to understand user requests, create execution plans, and autonomously execute terminal commands while providing comprehensive feedback and error recovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Mode AI Interaction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the AI in both autonomous agent mode and conversational chat mode, so that I can get both automated task execution and advisory guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Agent" mode THEN the system SHALL analyze requests, create execution plans, and autonomously execute terminal commands
2. WHEN the user selects "Chat" mode THEN the system SHALL provide conversational DevOps guidance without executing commands
3. WHEN the user switches between modes THEN the system SHALL maintain session context and update the UI accordingly
4. IF the user is in agent mode THEN the placeholder text SHALL read "Describe what you want me to do"
5. IF the user is in chat mode THEN the placeholder text SHALL read "Ask me anything about DevOps..."

### Requirement 2: Multi-Agent Workflow System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to break down complex requests into understandable phases with clear feedback, so that I can track progress and understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an agent request THEN the system SHALL execute a 4-phase workflow: Understanding → Planning → Execution → Summarization
2. WHEN the Understanding phase executes THEN the system SHALL analyze user intent, identify technologies, assess complexity, and generate structured objectives
3. WHEN the Planning phase executes THEN the system SHALL create step-by-step terminal command sequences with descriptions
4. WHEN the Execution phase runs THEN the system SHALL execute commands with real-time monitoring, error recovery, and progress updates
5. WHEN the Summarization phase completes THEN the system SHALL generate human-friendly summaries with accomplishments and next steps
6. IF any phase fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses and continue workflow where possible

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Terminal Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless terminal interaction with visual feedback and output management, so that I can clearly see command execution and results without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands execute THEN the system SHALL provide visual separators between different commands
2. WHEN output exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL truncate intelligently while preserving important information
3. WHEN the agent executes steps THEN the system SHALL show step indicators with descriptions and status
4. WHEN commands complete THEN the system SHALL display success/failure indicators with appropriate colors
5. IF terminal output becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL limit output to prevent memory issues while maintaining usability

### Requirement 4: Performance-Optimized Command Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast response times for simple commands while maintaining full analysis for complex operations, so that the system feels responsive and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing simple commands (touch, mkdir, ls, pwd) THEN the system SHALL complete in under 2 seconds using fast paths
2. WHEN executing moderate commands (git, npm, pip) THEN the system SHALL complete in under 10 seconds using cached explanations
3. WHEN executing complex commands THEN the system SHALL provide full analysis while maintaining optimized performance
4. WHEN similar commands are repeated THEN the system SHALL use cached results to improve response times
5. IF command classification determines low complexity THEN the system SHALL bypass heavy LLM analysis

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect and recover from command failures, so that I don't have to manually troubleshoot common issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command fails THEN the system SHALL analyze the error and generate appropriate recovery strategies
2. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL suggest and attempt privilege escalation solutions
3. WHEN dependency errors occur THEN the system SHALL identify missing packages and attempt installation
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL test connectivity and suggest network troubleshooting steps
5. IF recovery attempts succeed THEN the system SHALL re-execute the original command and continue the workflow
6. IF recovery attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and manual resolution steps

### Requirement 6: Code Application and Terminal Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily apply AI-suggested code and commands directly to my terminal, so that I can quickly implement recommendations without manual copying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI provides code blocks THEN the system SHALL display "Copy" and "Apply" buttons for each block
2. WHEN the user clicks "Apply" THEN the system SHALL send the code directly to the active terminal session
3. WHEN code is applied THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing successful application
4. WHEN no terminal is active THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to open a terminal first
5. IF the terminal connection is lost THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 7: Session Management and Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple chat sessions and terminal sessions independently, so that I can organize different projects and conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create or load existing chat sessions
2. WHEN the user creates a new chat session THEN the system SHALL generate a unique session ID and initialize with system prompts
3. WHEN the user switches between sessions THEN the system SHALL preserve conversation history and context
4. WHEN terminal sessions are created THEN the system SHALL maintain independent terminal processes with unique session IDs
5. IF sessions are deleted THEN the system SHALL clean up associated resources and WebSocket connections

### Requirement 8: Real-Time Visual Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual indicators of agent activity and progress, so that I understand what the system is doing and how long it might take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent workflow starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator with current phase and elapsed time
2. WHEN phases transition THEN the system SHALL update visual indicators with appropriate icons and descriptions
3. WHEN workflow completes THEN the system SHALL show completion status with success/failure indication
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error recovery indicators and progress
5. IF workflow takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL continue showing progress without timeout

### Requirement 9: DevOps Domain Expertise

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the AI to have deep knowledge of infrastructure, containerization, CI/CD, and related technologies, so that I can get expert-level assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN asked about infrastructure THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on AWS, GCP, Azure, Terraform, and CloudFormation
2. WHEN asked about containerization THEN the system SHALL provide expertise on Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and Docker Compose
3. WHEN asked about CI/CD THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and CircleCI
4. WHEN asked about monitoring THEN the system SHALL provide expertise on Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, and observability
5. WHEN asked about security THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on SAST, DAST, vulnerability scanning, and secrets management

### Requirement 10: WebSocket-Based Real-Time Communication

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates and streaming responses, so that I can see progress and results as they happen without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generates responses THEN the system SHALL stream tokens in real-time via WebSocket
2. WHEN commands execute THEN the system SHALL stream output in real-time to the terminal interface
3. WHEN agent phases transition THEN the system SHALL send immediate status updates via WebSocket
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate error notifications via WebSocket
5. IF WebSocket connections fail THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection and display connection status
