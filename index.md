# SudoSu automatically:
# 1. Analyzes the request
# 2. Plans the installation and configuration steps
# 3. Executes: apt update, install nginx, configure proxy, restart service
# 4. Provides friendly summary of what was accomplished
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# User request: "Create a new Python project with virtual environment"
# SudoSu automatically:
# 1. Creates project directory
# 2. Sets up virtual environment
# 3. Creates requirements.txt and basic project structure
# 4. Initializes git repository
```
